## Instructions for building the official rpms.
##
The process used to create the official rpms is as follows:

Download latest stable libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as follows:
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared 

Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

Check for a successful universal binary of libevent.a in, by default,
/usr/local/lib by using the following command:
	"file /usr/local/lib/libevent.a"

Download and Extract the latest tor source code from
https://www.torproject.org/download

In the resulting directory:
LIBS=-lrt ./configure
make dist-rpm

You should have at least two, maybe three, rpms.  There should be the binary
i386.rpm, a src.rpm, and on redhat/centos machines, a debuginfo.rpm.
